# AI-Fashion
This is the project I worked with team via BIP - Apply AI in Smart everything in Burgos, Spain.

Being a part of the RUN – European University BIP Program: Smart Everything - Connecting AI Tools with Business Ideas.

This inspiring initiative brought together students across disciplines to design AI-powered solutions with a clear business vision. The program included an engaging online learning phase, followed by an enriching face-to-face week in Burgos, Spain.

As part of the program, our international team developed "Revela" – An innovative AI-powered fashion assistant built using RAG-based chatbot architecture.

👗 Key features of Revela:
